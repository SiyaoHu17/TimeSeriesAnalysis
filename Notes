Objective:
facilitate bidders to win license plate bidding with lowest cost
facilitate government to regulate pricing
use time series analysis to forcast future average bidding price

Motivation:
5% success rate

Data source:
Kaggle.com, statistics from web pages
Technique:
Time series analysis for forecasting (Seasonal ARIMA, TBATS, and STLM) 
Tools: 
R(package “forecast”), MS Excel


Data preparation:
Get data through reseach (monthly successful average bidding price from January 2002 to July 2018) 
Add new data points (added the additional price data from August 2018 to November 2018 based on the researches)
deal with deficit through assumptions (combined amount due to the Chinese New Year)

Industry research, policy research

Define metirc:
based on researches and objective(closer to average will win)
average price of license plate
Investigate, include policy impact, other variables and time series

Data exploration:
find out trend, seasonality
special pattern breaks (ad-hoc analysis)(government issued policy->price decrease)

Feature engineering:
trend, seasonality(11 dummies), policy(restart from 1), cyclicity
number of available plates, lowest successful bidding price, monthly total number of applicants
average bidding prices 

Modeling:
predict future prices
191 month traning set, 12 month mesting set, RMSE(unit $matters>MAPE)
five time series models: Naïve, linear regression, multiple regression, sommthing, arima (forecast package)
adjust model based on PACF to include lag
best model: linear regression (2727.74 RSME on the testing set)


Forecast:
retrain the model using all data
forecast one year of average pricing + 95% intervals

Outcome:
97.21% accuracy, 20+ times 
bidders: forecast as reference for bidders: pricing and range, bidding strategy: when to bid within one year
